# Joke Fetcher App

This simple app fetches jokes from an API and displays them. Here are some ways we could improve it:

## Acceptance criteria

> 1. Given a Joke API
>    When the page first loads
>    Then a random joke will be displayed on the page

> 2. Given a joke has already been fetched and displayed
>    When the user clicks the "Get New Joke" button
>    Then a new random joke will be fetched and replace the existing one

> 3. Given there is a network connectivity issue
>    When the user clicks the "Get Joke" button
>    Then an error message will display instead of a joke
